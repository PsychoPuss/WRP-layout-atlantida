The current Octagon collection offers wonderfully spacious family homes in premier locations with prices starting from £750,000 rising to over £20m. Our <a href="http://www.octagonbespoke.co.uk/">Octagon Bespoke</a> division offers clients the opportunity to design and build their dream home to their own requirements and specification.</p>
				<p>Aspiring Octagon clients can consider moving into one of our new homes under our upper middle market division, <a href="http://www.chanceryhomes.co.uk/">Chancery Homes</a>.</p>
				<p>The talented Octagon in-house team of designers and architects are responsible for all our houses and apartments, each with distinguishing features that give every building a unique character, but still retaining the unmistakable Octagon style.</p>
				<p>As well as exquisite exteriors, <a href="https://www.octagon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Octagon-Interiors-Summary-Brochure.pdf">Octagon Interiors</a> offers a comprehensive interior design service, whereby clients work directly with our in-house team to create a personalised scheme that mirrors the splendor of the exterior architecture, unlocking the full potential of each new home.</p>
				<p>Our classic exterior design, surrounded by beautifully landscaped gardens, combined with beautiful contemporary interiors, featuring the latest high tech gadgetry and appliances, proves year on year a winning formula. The Octagon Group has received over several hundred build and design awards, but almost more importantly, has welcomed back many returning purchasers since building our first homes in the eighties.</p>
