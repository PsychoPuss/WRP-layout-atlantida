					<h1>Interior trends to look out for in 2023</h1>
					<p class="news-item__date">08/12/2022</p>
					<p>
						With the new year almost upon us, a time for new beginnings and fresh starts, we sat down with our <b>head of interiors, rachel hall</b>, to hear what she thinks will be trending in the world of interior design in 2023.
					</p>

				<div class="news-item__body text-cols-2">
					<p><strong><em>On colour</em></strong></p>
					<p>“We’ve been incorporating hints of green into our interior design schemes, through soft furnishings, wall colours, furniture or plants for the last couple of years. This influx of green likely stems from us seeking to strengthen our connection with nature and its supportive qualities. It helps to channel a sense of well-being within our homes, welcoming the benefits of the great outdoors into our own personal sanctuaries to create a sense of calm and restfulness. In 2023 I think it will take on a bigger role and whether it’s Sage Green, Royal Green or Dulux’s ‘Wild Wonder’, their 2023 colour of the year, the 50 shades of green are here for the long haul!</p>
					<p>Monochromatic interiors have also been extremely popular for the last couple of years – think Kim Kardashians Vincent Van Duysen home – but I’m seeing clients requesting injecting warmer colours into schemes now. I think that will continue into 2023.”</p>
					<p><strong><em>On materials</em></strong></p>
					<p>“Our fabric houses have started showing us their new collections and there seems to be a lot of beautiful and colourful printed velvets.”</p>
					<p><strong><em>On sustainability</em></strong></p>
					<p>“It’s been a buzzword in the property and interiors industry for a while – but sustainability is a key theme for 2023 – that is, taking a sustainable approach to furnishing super prime properties. It’s not just about sustainable materials, although of course that feeds into it too. It’s about upcycling, and reusing furniture, or buying investment pieces that will stand the test of time. Or indeed sourcing antiques which have a history and a story behind them. Adopting this approach means we’re injecting more character into homes, making them less of a show home – and understandably too, given that we are living in our homes more than ever.</p>
					<p>With the theme of sustainability comes a trend for using natural and organic materials—think stoneware, limestone, marble, and quartz being used across the board from backsplashes to bathtubs, furniture, and decorative objects. Together with neutral colours and the use of more organic materials for soft furnishings, such as cashmere and linen – the result is an understated elegance, that commands attention in a more discrete way.”</p>
					<p><strong><em>On lighting</em></strong></p>
					<p>“It’s all about layering when it comes to lighting. Mix spotlights with wall, floor and side lamps to create a beautifully designed space that has a warm and calming atmosphere that’s both practical and comfortable.”</p>
					<p><strong><em>On panelling</em></strong></p>
					<p>“With there being a movement towards a more classical feel in design it’s no wonder panelling is becoming increasingly popular. Panelling adds charm and character to a home – it can make a large space more intimate and cosy or make a small room feel spacious.</p>
					<p>Formerly reserved for dining rooms to help protect walls from chairs during raucous parties, panelling has become hugely popular– and has been used in a multitude of rooms. It’s an extremely versatile trend that adds warmth, personality and texture to a room. But it’s not just the walls that are being panelled! We’re adding it to wardrobes and kitchens and as a frontage for joinery, or even to disguise a secret door! Next year I think you’ll see more reeded and slatted panelling as a decorative feature wall or as a backdrop for tv walls.”</p>
