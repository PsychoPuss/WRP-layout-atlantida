							<p>Octagon presents a luxurious development of just nine new 4 and 5 bedroom townhouses in Bishops Park, a conservation area that runs parallel to the River Thames in Fulham.</p>
							<p>Designed for family living, these deceptively spacious homes combine high-spec finishes with spectacular terrace and balcony views of the river, along with an outlook onto the adjacent park. The properties are between 4,375 &mdash; 6,150 sq ft, and so offer versatile and flexible accommodation arranged over 5 floors. The generous living space includes 4 formal reception rooms, as well as a gym and TV den / cinema room, which leads onto a covered courtyard garden with a walk-on glass ceiling. These leisure spaces on the lower ground floor could have flexible uses to suit individual requirements.</p>
							<p>The enviable kitchen/breakfast/family room opens onto a west backing walled garden and features modern linear handle-less cabinets, quartz worktops and top-of-the-range integrated Miele appliances. The formal drawing room has a modern limestone fireplace complemented by a timber flooring and inset carpet and leads onto an additional outside rear terrace.</p>
							<p>Included in the renowned Octagon specification for this luxury home in Stevenage Road, Fulham is a building management system, boosted Wifi, comfort cooling and part air conditioning. There is intelligent lighting and underfloor heating throughout.</p>
							<p>Bishops Row is a moments&rsquo; walk from the River Thames and its tow-path access to Putney Bridge. The District Line underground station is nearby. There are 2 further Underground options at Parsons Green and Fulham Broadway. London Victoria is less than 20 minutes away. Fulham&rsquo;s vibrant centre is nearby, with its shops, bars, boutiques and notable restaurants like the Michelin-starred River Caf&eacute;, which is just 0.4 miles/3 minute walk from the property. Fulham also currently boasts the only Michelin starred gastropub in London: the Harwood Arms.</p>
							<p>Fulham is renowned for its excellent local schooling such as London Oratory School, Fulham Prep School, Latymer Upper School, Fulham Cross Girls&rsquo; School and Chelsea Independent College.</p>
